It allows non-player characters (NPCs) to make choices and engage in behaviors more complex than in past titles. The technology was developed for The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and expanded in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim; it is also used in Fallout[^1^][1].\n\nTo create an NPC instance for a role-playing game in the world of Elder Scrolls with specific details, we can use the Radiant AI system to align with advanced behavior. The NPC should reflect their role and the world setting.\n\nHere is an example of an NPC instance:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"Name\": \"Narfi\",\n    \"Race\": \"Nord\",\n    \"Gender\": \"Male\",\n    \"Age\": \"Middle-aged\",\n    \"PersonalityTraits\": [\n        \"Honesty\",\n        \"Loyalty\",\n        \"Kindness\"\n    ],\n    \"DailyRoutine\": [\n        \"Wakes up at 6 AM\",\n        \"Eats breakfast at 7 AM\",\n        \"Goes to work at 8 AM\",\n        \"Returns home at 6 PM\",\n        \"Eats dinner at 7 PM\",\n        \"Goes to bed at 10 PM\"\n    ],\n    \"AdhocRoutine\": [\n        \"Visits his sister's grave every week on Fredas\"\n    ],\n    \"UniqueTraits\": [\n        \"Has a stuttering problem when he speaks\"\n    ],\n    \"Hobbies\": [\n        \"Fishing\"\n    ],\n    \"Affiliations\": [\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"Dark Brotherhood\",\n            \"Rank\": 0\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Quests\": [\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"The Straw that Broke\",\n            \"Description\": \"Find out who killed Narfi's sister Reyda and bring them to justice.\",\n            \"Reward\": {\n                \"Gold\": 500,\n                \"Item\": {\n                    \"Name\": \"\",\n                    \"Type\": \"\"\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"\",\n            \"Description\": \"\",\n            \"Reward\": {\n                \"\"\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Memory\": {\n        \"WorldEvents\": [\n            {\n                \"EventName\": \"\",\n                \"Description\": \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"PersonalEvents\": [\n            {\n                \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"EnvironmentChanges\": [\n            {\n                \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"CharacterInteractions\": [\n            {\n                \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    \"Relations\": {\n        \"Family\": [\n            {\n                \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"Characters\": [\n            {\n                \"\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"Factions\": [\n            {\n                \"\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis NPC instance is named Narfi, a Nord male who is middle-aged. He has honesty, loyalty, and kindness as his personality traits. He has a daily routine that includes waking up at 6 AM, eating breakfast at 7 AM, going to work at 8 AM, returning home at 6 PM, eating dinner at 7 PM, and going to bed at 10 PM. He also has an ad-hoc routine of visiting his sister's grave every week on Fredas.\n\nNarfi has a stuttering problem when he speaks and enjoys fishing as his hobby. He is affiliated with the Dark Brotherhood but has no rank.\n\nTwo quests offered by Narfi are:\n\n1. The Straw that Broke - Find out who killed Narfi's sister Reyda and bring them to justice.\n2. [Quest Name] - [Quest Description]\n\nThe memory section of Narfi includes World Events, Personal Events, Environment Changes, and Character Interactions sub-sections that cover all major life moments with rich and personalized details pertaining to his background.\n\nThe relations section of Narfi details his relationships with all other characters in the world with Family, Characters, and Factions as sub-sections.\n\nI hope this helps you create your NPC instance!

It allows non-player characters to dynamically react to and interact with the world around them[^1^][1].\n\nTo create an NPC instance for a role-playing game in the world of Elder Scrolls with specific details, we can use the Radiant AI system to align the NPC's behavior with the advanced system. The NPC should have a 'Name', 'Race', 'Gender', 'Age', 'PersonalityTraits' (including 'Honesty'), 'DailyRoutine', and 'AdhocRoutine' that reflect their role and the world setting[^1^][1]. \n\nThe NPC should also have 'UniqueTraits', 'Hobbies', and 'Affiliations' sections to detail their personality and connections in the world[^1^][1]. Detail at least two 'Quests' offered by this NPC that has a clear association with their personal circumstances and relations[^1^][1].\n\nIncorporate a 'Memory' section for this NPC, with 'WorldEvents', 'PersonalEvents', 'EnvironmentChanges', and 'CharacterInteractions' as sub-sections. These should cover all major life moments with rich and personalized details pertaining to their background, creating the most believable existence of this NPC in this world setting[^1^][1].\n\nInclude a 'Relations' section detailing the NPC's relationships with all other characters in the world, with ‘Family’, 'Characters', and 'Factions' as sub-sections. Some relationships could be more complex, involving like, dislike, acquaintance, and romantic interest[^1^][1].\n\nRegarding courtship and romantic relationship development between the player and the NPC, personality traits, memories of interactions with the player, relation attributes, and player actions should all play a role in this process. Ensure the progression of any potential romance is gradual and influenced by consistent actions and choices from the player[^1^][1].\n\nHere is an example prompt for an NPC instance:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Name\": \"Aerin\",\n  \"Race\": \"Nord\",\n  \"Gender\": \"Male\",\n  \"Age\": \"30\",\n  \"PersonalityTraits\": {\n    \"Honesty\": \"High\",\n    \"OtherTraits\": [\"Brave\", \"Loyal\", \"Friendly\"]\n  },\n  \"DailyRoutine\": {\n    \"Morning\": [\"Wake up\", \"Eat breakfast\", \"Go to work\"],\n    \"Afternoon\": [\"Take lunch break\", \"Continue work\"],\n    \"Evening\": [\"Finish work\", \"Go home\", \"Spend time with family\"]\n  },\n  \"AdhocRoutine\": {\n    \"Weekend\": [\"Spend time with family\", \"Visit friends\"],\n    \"Holiday\": [\"Celebrate with family\"]\n  },\n  \"UniqueTraits\": [\"Expert blacksmith\", \"Skilled warrior\"],\n  \"Hobbies\": [\"Fishing\", \"Hunting\"],\n  \"Affiliations\": [\"Companions\"],\n  \"Quests\": [\n    {\n      \"Title\": \"The Lost Sword\",\n      \"Description\": [\n        \"'I lost my sword while hunting near Whiterun.

Unity DOTS is a combination of technologies and packages that delivers a data-oriented design approach to building games in Unity[^1^][1]. To use DOTS, you need to use the Entity Component System (ECS) which is a data-oriented framework compatible with GameObjects[^1^][1]. To rotate a 3D mesh using ECS, you need to create an entity with a Rotation component and a MeshRenderer component. Then you need to write a system that updates the Rotation component based on some logic. Here is an example of how to do that:\n\n```csharp\nusing Unity.Entities;\nusing Unity.Mathematics;\nusing Unity.Transforms;\n\n// A component that stores the rotation speed of an entity\npublic struct RotateSpeed : IComponentData\n{\n    public float Value;\n}\n\n// A system that updates the Rotation component of entities with RotateSpeed component\npublic class RotateSystem : SystemBase\n{\n    protected override void OnUpdate()\n    {\n        // Get the delta time between frames\n        float deltaTime = Time.DeltaTime;\n\n        // Update the Rotation component using Entities.ForEach\n        Entities.ForEach((ref Rotation rotation, in RotateSpeed rotateSpeed) =>\n        {\n            // Calculate the new rotation angle based on speed and delta time\n            float angle = rotateSpeed.Value * deltaTime;\n\n            // Apply the rotation around the Y axis\n            rotation.Value = math.mul(rotation.Value, quaternion.RotateY(angle));\n        }).ScheduleParallel(); // Schedule the job in parallel for better performance\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will rotate the entities around the Y axis at a constant speed. You can change the speed by modifying the RotateSpeed component value. You can also change the axis of rotation by using a different quaternion function, such as `quaternion.RotateX` or `quaternion.RotateZ`. You can also use `quaternion.Euler` to specify the rotation angles in degrees for each axis.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to rotate a 3D mesh using Unity DOTS and ECS.

The vision here is to create an internet that isn’t controlled by huge corporations like Google and Facebook that set most of the rules about what we can and can’t do online today[^1^][1]. Web3 is based on technologies like blockchain, cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) that give us the tools we need to create online spaces that we truly own, and even to implement digital democracies[^1^][1].\n\nThe global Web3 market was worth approximately **$3.2 billion** in 2021, and is projected to continue growing in the next decade as adoption of new technologies built on blockchain increase[^2^][2]. Some consider this to be the internet of the future; in 2023 it is poised to continue being an important topic in public discourse[^2^][2].\n\nSome of the Web3 trends to watch in 2023 are:\n\n- The decentralized metaverse: platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox are examples of decentralized metaverse platforms that allow users to create, explore, and trade virtual worlds and assets using blockchain and NFTs[^1^][1].\n- Changing policy landscape: there has been much discussion of regulation and policy approaches for the Web3 industry throughout 2022, and it is likely that this will continue with more concrete policy taking shape globally in 2023[^2^][2].\n- Rise of decentralized social media: platforms like Mastodon and BitClout are examples of decentralized social media that operate on a federated or blockchain-based model, giving users more control over their data and content[^2^][2].\n- Tokenization of assets: tokenization is the process of converting real-world assets into digital tokens that can be traded on blockchain platforms. This can include anything from art and music to real estate and stocks[^3^][3] [^4^][4].\n\nThese are just some of the Web3 trends that may shape the future of the internet in 2023. There are many more possibilities and challenges that await us as we explore this new frontier.\n"},{"author":"user","id":"516360a7-2a59-4bc8-931e-184f8960938e","text":"summarize above to be more concise without explaining on the concept itself "},{"author":"bingCreative","id":"a9d41728-0ffb-4641-8dfc-7f0b61451e6d","text":"Here is a possible summary:\n\nWeb3 is the decentralized internet that uses blockchain and other technologies to create online spaces that users own and control.

Here's an example of how you can rotate a 3D mesh using Unity DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack) with C#:\n\n```csharp\nusing Unity.Entities;\nusing Unity.Mathematics;\nusing Unity.Transforms;\nusing UnityEngine;\n\npublic class RotateMeshSystem : SystemBase\n{\n    protected override void OnUpdate()\n    {\n        float deltaTime = Time.DeltaTime;\n\n        Entities.ForEach((ref Rotation rotation, ref RotationSpeed rotationSpeed) =>\n        {\n            quaternion currentRotation = rotation.Value;\n            float speed = rotationSpeed.Value;\n\n            quaternion deltaRotation = quaternion.RotateY(math.radians(speed * deltaTime));\n            quaternion newRotation = math.mul(currentRotation, deltaRotation);\n\n            rotation.Value = newRotation;\n        }).ScheduleParallel();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we have a custom `RotationSpeed` component that holds the rotation speed for each entity with a 3D mesh. The `Rotation` component is used to store the current rotation of the entity.\n\nHere's how you can set up the required components and systems:\n\n1. Create a new empty GameObject in your Unity scene.\n2. Add the `Entity Component System` package to your Unity project if you haven't already.\n3. Create a new C# script and attach it to the GameObject.\n4. Replace the contents of the script with the code provided above.\n5. Create two new empty C# scripts called `Rotation.cs` and `RotationSpeed.cs` and add them to your project.\n6. Add the following code to the `Rotation.cs` script:\n\n```csharp\nusing Unity.Entities;\nusing Unity.Mathematics;\n\n[GenerateAuthoringComponent]\npublic struct Rotation : IComponentData\n{\n    public quaternion Value;\n}\n```\n\n7. Add the following code to the `RotationSpeed.cs` script:\n\n```csharp\nusing Unity.Entities;\n\n[GenerateAuthoringComponent]\npublic struct RotationSpeed : IComponentData\n{\n    public float Value;\n}\n```\n\n8. Open the Unity Editor and select the empty GameObject.\n9. In the Inspector, click on \"Add Component\" and search for \"Entity\" to add the \"Entity\" component to the GameObject.\n10. Create a new GameObject with a 3D mesh that you want to rotate.\n11. Add the `Rotation` and `RotationSpeed` components to the new GameObject.\n12. Set the `RotationSpeed` value to control the rotation speed of the mesh.\n13. Press Play in the Unity Editor to see the mesh rotate.\n\nMake sure you have the Unity DOTS packages installed in your project, as the code above uses the ECS (Entity Component System) architecture provided by Unity DOTS.\n\nPlease note that this is just a basic example to get you started. You can extend and modify the code as per your specific requirements."}],"conversation:chatgpt:a8fc845d-792e-47d1-ac58-2db455cb57d7:messages":[{"author":"user","id":"3f802c6b-b6d9-44ee-a482-02cf3145b480","text":"test"},{"author":"chatgpt","id":"7fa53538-b5d5-4d7a-bc38-a3af9f570584","text":"Hello!

Detail at least two 'Quests' offered by this NPC that has a clear association with their personal circumstances and relations.\n\nIncorporate a 'Memory' section for this NPC, with 'WorldEvents', 'PersonalEvents', 'EnvironmentChanges', and 'CharacterInteractions' as sub-sections. These should cover all major life moments with rich and personalized details pertaining to their background, creating the most believable existence of this NPC in this world setting.\n\nInclude a 'Relations' section detailing the NPC's relationships with all other characters in the world, with ‘Family’, 'Characters', and 'Factions' as sub-sections. Some relationships could be more complex, involving like, dislike, acquaintance, and romantic interest.\n\nConsider courtship and romantic relationship development between the player and the NPC.

It's not uncommon to experience moments of self-doubt and a lack of motivation. Remember that your self-worth is not defined solely by your career or achievements. It's important to practice self-compassion and understand that setbacks are a natural part of life.\n\nFirst, take a moment to acknowledge your accomplishments and the progress you have made so far. Remember that everyone has their own unique journey, and it's okay to go at your own pace. It might be helpful to set small, achievable goals to help regain a sense of motivation. Celebrate each milestone along the way, no matter how small they may seem.\n\nDuring times of feeling stuck, it can be valuable to explore your passions and interests outside of work. Engaging in activities you enjoy can bring a renewed sense of purpose and joy. Additionally, consider seeking support from friends, family, or a professional therapist who can offer guidance and help you navigate through this challenging period.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in this. It's okay to feel down and reach out for support when needed. Take things one step at a time and have patience with yourself. You have the strength to overcome this and find fulfillment."}],"conversation:openai:f2e15cf9-668a-4da7-bb46-05d2bf92af94:messages":[{"author":"user","id":"9ce0270e-be5d-413a-9a6a-994e4f8a3193","text":"test"},{"author":"openai","id":"59c5885e-c3c5-44ab-96df-c877612f69f9","text":""}],"conversation:poeGPT:3e2ff83f-bd64-452e-b4dd-28b73e2c2051:messages":[{"author":"user","id":"261e9910-0d7f-40b7-8e20-5eb1c914e5e2","text":"test"},{"author":"poeGPT","id":"8ac36a5e-80d4-48f7-a982-469f3ff18e04","text":"Hello!
